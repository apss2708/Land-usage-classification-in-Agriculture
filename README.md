THIS file is a data preprocessing and classification file focused on land usage classification in agriculture.

	•	The file begins with an introduction, objectives, and abstract, explaining that it aims to classify different types of land usage (likely using remote sensing or agricultural imagery).
	•	It loads training and testing datasets containing multiple color bands (Im_Red, Im_Green, Im_Blue, Mk_Red, Mk_Green, Mk_Blue) and a HEX column for color representation.
	•	The data is cleaned and converted to the correct types (int64), ensuring compatibility for further analysis or modeling.
	•	JSON metadata and possibly class definitions are read in and organized into a dictionary for easier access.
	•	Loops are used to restructure class data and print out the available classes and their attributes.
	•	The file then inspects the datasets (e.g., info() summaries) to check column types, memory usage, and overall shape.
	•	Based on the naming and structure, this sets the stage for a machine learning classification task, likely predicting land usage categories from the given spectral/color data.

It’s essentially a preparation pipeline:
Load → Clean → Structure → Inspect → Ready for Modeling.
